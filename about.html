        <h2>My Vision</h2>
        <p>Like all kids with a dream, I aspire to have the world in my hands. Just kidding! :) I aim to use my skills to create innovative and impactful tech solutions that are actively changing the way we do things and improve our lives for the better. Whether it's developing secure applications, analyzing data for insights, or building intelligent AI systems, I want to be a part of that change.

    <section id="beyond-tech">
        <h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
        <p>When I'm not deep in debugging my program lines, I enjoy gaming, which has inspired me to start a YouTube channel dedicated to in-depth game reviews on all kinds of video games, from the AAA blockbusters to the obscure indie treasures. I may have gone overboard with the gaming talk! :) I also have a deep appreciation for business and investing, exploring opportunities in the Botswana Stock Exchange and beyond.</p>
